# This partition table has been used in a much larger project that included
# AWS IOT Core services and the ability to OTA.  Future examples will require
# this more advanced partition table.

# Note: We allow the system to calculate the memory Offsets.

# ota app partitions are set to 6.5Mb
#
# FYI - Encryption information is supplied here for instruction, but none of it is active until you actually invoke encryption.
#
# NOTE: nvs partition cannot be encrypted - but data is still stored in encrypted form. (requires Flash encryption)
# NOTE: app partitions are always treated as encrypted when encryption enabled at a system level (no need to flag it)
# NOTE: Encryption requires boot offset from partition table to be set at 0xC000 (this is set in menuConfig)
# NOTE: Subtype nvs_keys must be of type data with a minumum size of 0x1000 and marked encrypted.
#
# add flags as follows when applying encryption above
#
# nvs_key,    data,   nvs_keys,         ,   0x001000, encrypted
# phy_init,   data,   phy,              ,   0x001000, encrypted
